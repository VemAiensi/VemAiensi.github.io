                                    A guy who takes so long to learn stuffs.
                                    He maybe slow, but he actually does the job in a pleasing manner.
                                    This guy is responsible for the UI's design as well as the assets
                                    that were used in the project. He's also the reason why this project
                                    took longer than expected XD
